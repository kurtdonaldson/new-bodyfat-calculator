The bodyfat-calculator is a full stack web app with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. The purpose of the app is to provide health care workers with a way to calculate a clients bodyfat percentage and then save this data to a database so that it can be tracked over time. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for front end development. I used NodeJS and Express on the server side. Client data was saved to the non-relational database MongoDB using Mongoose. I used RESTful routing in order to map HTTP methods and CRUD actions. I used Passport authentication in order to verify new users. The app was deployed to Heroku.
